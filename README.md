This project implements a real-time face recognition system using deep learning. It combines YOLO (for fast face detection) with MTCNN for precise face alignment and InceptionResnetV1 for generating high-quality face embeddings. The system allows adding known faces from images and identifies people in a live webcam stream by comparing embeddings using Euclidean distance. It includes low-light enhancement, YOLO-based multi-face detection, adjustable recognition thresholds, and GPU/CPU compatibility. This project is ideal for beginners and developers building intelligent vision-based authentication or smart surveillance applications.
